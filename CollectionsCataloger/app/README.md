- A brief (one paragraph description) of what your project does.
  - My project is meant to be used to track a collection (for my use case, it was stickers), and allow for easy lookup later. It includes a simple layout/functionality that allows the user to add, edit, and delete item "entries", consisting of an img, title, and a list of tags that a certain item may have. Adding this list of tags allows the user to easily look up items with similar attrbiutes. 
- Your Figma design (either PNGs exported from Figma or a link to your Figma project)
